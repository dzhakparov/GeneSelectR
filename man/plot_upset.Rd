\title{Plot Feature Overlaps Using UpSet Plots}
\usage{
plot_upset(pipeline_results, custom_lists = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{pipeline_results}{A PipelineResults object containing the fitted pipelines, cross-validation results, selected features,
mean performance, and mean feature importances.}

\item{custom_lists}{An optional named list of character vectors. Each character vector should contain feature names.
The names of the list will be used as names in the UpSet plots.}
}
\value{
A named list containing two UpSet plots accessible as \code{result$inbuilt_importance} for inbuilt feature importances
and \code{result$permutation_importance} for permutation importances.
}
\description{
This function produces separate UpSet plots for inbuilt feature importances and permutation importances,
allowing you to visualize the overlap of feature lists. Optionally, you can include custom lists.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
pipeline_results <- PipelineResults$new(...)
custom_lists <- list("custom1" = c("gene1", "gene2"), "custom2" = c("gene3", "gene4"))
result <- plot_feature_overlap_upset(pipeline_results, custom_lists)
print(result$plot1)
print(result$plot2)
}
